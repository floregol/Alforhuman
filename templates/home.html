				<h2 class="mt-3">Disclaimer</h2>

				<p>
					If you agree to proceed, you will participate in an experiment in which you will be asked to look at
					images and to categorize them.
				</p>
				<p>
					The categorization task is based on a rule that you will have to infer based on the examples that
					will be shown to you.
					The experiment is divided in three parts.
				</p>
				<p>
					1) Initially, you will be shown some of the images and their associated categories, marked by either
					0 or 1.<p></p>
					<p>	2) Then, you will be asked to categorize some new images. You will receive feedback on wether or not
					you chose the right category for each image.
				</p><p>
					During those first 2 phases, you should try to infer the rule based on the feedback you receive.
				</p>
				<p>
					3) The last step is the testing phase, you will again be asked to categorize some images but
					feedback won't be provided.
				</p>
				<p>
