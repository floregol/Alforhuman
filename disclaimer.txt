[State what will happen] 
If you agree to proceed, you will participate in an experiment in which you will be asked to look at images and to categorize them. 

[Explain the task] 
The categorization task is based on a rule that you will have to infer based on the examples that will be shown to you.
The experiment is divided in three parts.

1) Initially, you will be shown some of the images and their associated categories, marked by either 0 or 1.
2) Then, you will be asked to categorize some new images. You will receive feedback on wether or not you chose the right category for each image.

During those first 2 phases, you should try to infer the rule based on the feedback you receive.

3) The last step is the testing phase, you will again be asked to categorize some images but feedback won't be provided.
