[State what will happen] 
If you agree to proceed, you will be participating in an experiment in which you will be asked to look at images and to categorize them. 

[Explain the task] 
The categorization task is based on a rule that you will have to infer based on the examples that will be shown to you.
The experiment is divided in three parts.

1) Initially, you will be shown some of the images and their category, encoded in either 0 or 1.
2) Then, you will be asked to categorize a few images and you will get instant feedback on if your categorization was right. 

During those first 2 phases, you should try to infer the rule based on the feedback you are getting.

3) The last step is the testing phase, you will again be asked to categorize some images but feedback won't be provided.
